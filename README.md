# Python-Survival

A little python game done with pygame.
My first game in Python. 
It's not clean at all because i am still doing tests on it.
I started python about one week before doing this game.

# Requirements 

    python 3.5 must be installed 
    pygame must be installed 


# Help 

to install pygame : 

    'pip install pygame' 
   or
    'python -m pip install pygame'
     
 
# 
 
Hope you will enjoy it.
Send me your bests score and try to do not cheat ;) ( The game is still a litle bugged so you can cheat easily but hard to patch so you will have to wait ! ) 

# Improve the game
 
If you enjoyed the game or if you just want to help me and other players, you can improve it !
